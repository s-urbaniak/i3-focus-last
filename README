i3-focus-last

This is a small utility for the i3 window manager [1] which enables Alt-Tab like functionality.

Add these lines to your i3 config:

    # windows focus
    bindsym Mod4+o exec ~/path/to/i3-focus-last prev
    bindsym Mod4+i exec ~/path/to/i3-focus-last next
    bindsym Mod4+b exec ~/path/to/i3-focus-last switch

At i3 startup i3-focus-last is started and keeps track of the currently and previously focused window. If one presses `$mod-Tab` i3-focus-last instructs the i3 window manager to switch to the previously focused window.
